# Pong, coded in Go, via Ebitengine

A minimal implementation of Pong in Go. 
Theoretically, to present in a short talk where I will live code Pong.

Fun, as Go is primarily used as a backend language.

An aside.,,

Goal is to extend 'Pong' so the AI controlling player 2 will have pithy remarks for Player 1, i.e. "I beat Gary Kasparov, Deep Blue, and now I will beat you."
