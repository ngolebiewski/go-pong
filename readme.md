# Pong, coded in Go, via Ebitengine

A minimal implementation of Pong in Go. 
Theoretically, to present in a short talk where I will live code Pong.

Fun, as Go is primarily used as a backend language.

An aside.,,

Goal is to extend 'Pong' so the AI controlling player 2 will have pithy remarks for Player 1, i.e. "I beat Gary Kasparov, Deep Blue, and now I will beat you."

	// Hit space to start ball -- start state
	// -> make function to restart ball
	// Ball updates with some sort of direction!!!! should not be straight up down! How do you do that, radians?
	// Ball picks up velocity each hit, Direction opposite of incoming force? Based on where it hits paddle? --> ALL ABOUT THE velocityx and vy for the direction!
	// if player misses (goes over The 'X' borders) other player gets a point
	//
    TODO
	// make an AI opponent, and have it shout insults! LOL.
